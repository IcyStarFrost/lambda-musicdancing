# Music Box

The Music Box returns from Zeta Players! The Music Box is a entity that is specifically designed to play music in game that Lambdas can dance to. The Music Box can support any of these file types
- MP3
- WAV
- FLAC
- AAC
- OGG
- Anything else BASS audio system supports http://www.un4seen.com/doc/#bass/bass.html

The Music Box's main feature is its Music Visualizer that will follow the music as it plays

To add music to the Music Box, simply create folders until you get this file path: `DRIVE:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\sourceengine\sound\lambdaplayers\musicbox`

Addons can add music to the music box just by doing the same such as: `ADDONNAME/sound/lambdaplayers/musicbox/( Music files )`


Place your music files in `musicbox` and you are done! Just note that your music file names must be alphabetical/numerical only and should never be double spaced or else they won't be played by the Music Box.
